<p>
    A best friend is like a star; you don't always see them, but you know they're always there.
     <br>
    I am thankful, because I met them in different situations; they saved me when no one did.
     <br>
    Even though sometimes we don't check on each other, the care is still there when one needed it.
     <br>
    I love the idea that you can run to them when you feel everything is so heavy. You can rant on them. 
    <br>
</p>

<p2>
    Without judgement, they accept you for who you are, your imperfections, and your mistakes. 
    <br>
    I would like to express my appreciation for their existence. 
    <br> 
    I love all of them; everyone of them deserve all the happiness in this world
     <br>
    they mean so much to me.
